# Plugins

`envelop` plugins are based on a simple event-based contact that allows you to add more logic to your app. 

You can easily share and collaborate on plugins that you find generic.

This section will explain how `envelop` plugins works, and how you can write your own plugin. 

## Available Plugins

You can find a list of all plugins, their documentation and installation instructions in our [Plugins Hub](/plugins)!

## Write your own plugin!


> Feel free to share your plugin with the community or with us. Sharing = Caring!

#### The plugin interface

You can find it here: https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop/blob/main/packages/types/src/index.ts#L50

#### Execution Lifecycle

By extending the GraphQL execution pipeline, we allow developers to write reusable plugins that can be shared with others easily, as NPM packages. So instead of delivering a bloated GraphQL server with tons of features, we allow you to choose the HTTP server you prefer, the request pipeline you like, and the features you want.

We wrap the execution pipeline of GraphQL operation, and allow Envelop plugins to do the following:

- `parse`
  - Hook into the before/after of this phase
  - Override the parse function
  - Access to the parsed result
  - Modify the parsed result
- `validate`
  - Hook into the before/after of this phase
  - Override the validation function
  - Access to the validation error results
  - Modify the validation results
  - Add custom validation rules
- `contextFactory`
  - Hook into the before/after of this phase
  - Access to the initial HTTP request context
  - Extend the context with custom data
  - Replace the context object
- `execute`
  - Hook into the before/after of this phase
  - Extend the execution context
  - Access to all execution parameters
  - Replace the execute function
  - Access to the results / error of the execution
  - Access to before / after resolvers calls
  - Extend resolvers behavior
  - Access resolvers parameters
  - Replace / modify the execution result
- `subscribe`
  - Hook into the before/after of this phase
  - Extend the execution context
  - Access to all execution parameters
  - Replace the execute function
  - Access to the results / error of the execution
  - Access to before / after resolvers calls
  - Extend resolvers behavior
  - Access resolvers parameters
  - Replace / modify the subscription result

We also allow you to change the GraphQL schema during execution - so if your server has a schema that could change dynamically, you can constantly update it. As a result, we trigger a `schemaChange` event that allows plugins to respond accordingly.
