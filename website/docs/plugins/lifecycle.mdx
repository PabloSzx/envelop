## Plugins Lifecylce

Plugins are executed in order of their usage, and inject functionality serially.

The `before` functions are called in order, and then the `after` function of each hook will be called in the same order, when the phase has done.

The basic API allow you to keep the JS clousure between `before` and `after`, for example:

```ts
const myPlugin = {
  onParse({ params }) {
    // This is the before function

    return ({ result }) => {
      // The is the after function, 
      // JS Closure allow me to access the params here as well
    }
  }
}
```

## Plugins API

### `onPluginInit(api)`

This method is called only once when the plugin is being initialized.

**API**:

* `setSchema` - sets the initial schema to be used.
* `plugins` - list of all other loaded plugins.
* `addPlugin` - adds a plugin to the list of plugins.

### `onParse(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed.

**`before` API**:

* `params` - the original parameters passes to `parse` function.
* `parseFn` - the current `parse` function. By defualt, it's the one from `graphql` package.
* `setParseFn` - Replaces the `parse` function with a custom function.
* `setParsedDocument` - sets the parse result. Setting this will skip calling `parse` for the executed operation.

**`after` API**:

* `result` - the result `DocumentNode` of the parsing function.
* `replaceParseResult` - replaces the parsed result.

### `onValidate(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed.

**`before` API**:

* `params` - the original parameters passes to `validate` function.
* `validateFn` - the current `validate` function. By defualt, it's the one from `graphql` package.
* `setValidationFn` - Replaces the `validate` function with a custom function.
* `addValidationRule` - Adds a validation rule to the list of default validation rules (as defined in `graphql` package).
* `setResult` - sets the validation result. Setting this will skip calling `validate` for the executed operation.

**`after` API**:

* `valid` - A boolean indicates if the validation passed.
* `result` - `null` in case of valid document, otherwise an array of valiation errors.

### `onContext(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed. Used for building the GraphQL context incrementally.

**`before` API**:

* `context` - the context object built so far by other plugins.
* `extendContext` - extends the context object with additional fields.

**`after` API**:

* `context` - the eventual built context, by all plugins.

### `onExecute(api)`

Called every time an operation is being executed. The return value of this function is extended, and allow you to hooks into resolver calls if needed.

**`before` API**:

* `args` - arguments passes to `execute` (contains the document, variables and everything else that needed for executing the GraphQL operation)
* `executeFn` - the `execute` function to use, by default it's the one from `graphql` package.
* `setExecuteFn` - replaces the `execute` function.
* `setResultAndStopExecution` - sets the result of the execution immediately. Calling this function will stop execution.
* `extendContext` - allow you to extend the context before executin the operation. 

You can return an `object` from that function, with the following fields:

**`onExecuteDone` API**:

Triggered when the execution of the operation is done.

* `result` - the execution result.
* `setResult` - replaces the result. can either be with data or errors.

**`onResolverCalled` API**:

Triggered when a resolver is called during the execution of the operation.
