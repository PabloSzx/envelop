# What is Envelop?

<Text textAlign="justify">
  Envelop is a lightweight JavaScript library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and flow, allowing developers to develop, share
  and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations.
</Text>

### In depth

<Text marginTop="0.5em" textAlign="justify">
  Our goal is to allow developers to keep the original GraphQL interfaces while adding plugins to enrich the feature set of your
  application quickly while sharing ideas, code, and plugins with other developers.
</Text>

<Text marginTop="0.5em" textAlign="justify">
  Envelop is agnostic to the HTTP server you use, so it's not a traditional server. We do not aim to provide a complete server you
  can use Envelop with any environment (NodeJS or browser) and any GraphQL workflow (client/server, client-side execute, or server
  to server). So any piece of code that uses GraphQL's `execute` can benefit from that layer.
</Text>

<Text marginTop="0.5em" textAlign="justify">
  The core of Envelop is zero-dependency and will only apply changes to your GraphQL execution based on the plugins you wish to
  use. It can be integrated with any GraphQL server that follows [the execution phase, as defined in the GraphQL
  spec](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Executing-Requests) and let you provide your own lifecycle methods.
</Text>

<Text marginTop="0.5em" textAlign="justify">
  Separating the execution workflow and the logic that it runs in each phase allow you to write a reusable piece of code, like:
</Text>

- `logging`
- `metric collection`
- `error handling`
- `custom validations`
- `resolvers tracing` (and integration with any external service)
- `authentication`
- `authorization`

And <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">much more</Text>, without the need to write it explicitly every time in every project or microservice.

  With Envelop, you can easily create a wrapper around your common logic, and share it with others.
